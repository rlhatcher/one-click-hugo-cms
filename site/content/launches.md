    EARS currently hold monthly launches on a 1,600 acre farm near the village
    of Elsworth, which is about 15-20 minutes West of Cambridge. The launch site
    is excellent with ample parking and preparation areas. We now have a
    Port-a-Loo on site which makes it much easier for visitors with children.
    There is no on site water. The site is also a working farm and the farmer
    can be spraying his crops or working in fields close to the launch area,
    also launches around harvest can be affected.

        Our Landowner has decided that he needs to restrict access to motor
        vehicles on to his land. To do this he will be fitting gates to all the
        access roads on to the site. These gates will be locked. We will have
        access to the site through only one of these gates. This will be the
        access road in the middle of Rogues Lane (previous visitors will know
        this as the entrance we used to ask people not to use).

        The access tracks are very narrow concrete tracks with deep ditches
        either side. You CANNOT turn round or pass on them. Please be
        considerate and allow traffic already on a section of track to proceed
        towards you. Wait at the right angle corner turns patiently to allow
        room for traffic to pass. The sections of track are quite long and there
        are no other passing places than the corners.

      Because safety is our primary concern, all our flying is done in
      accordance with the UKRA Safety Code.

      We also require that all flyers have some form of third party insurance
      just in case something goes wrong. So if you wish to fly, we ask that you
      have at least BMFA insurance and we generally only allow you to fly within
      your certification level. For overseas and other visitors it is possible
      to take out a 1 month temporary membership and BMFA insurance. This will
      cover you up to G impulse or to a certification level held by members of
      other UKRA recognised rocketry organisations (TRA, NAR, CAR). To avoid
      disappointment please let us know in advance if you plan to do this by
      emailing us.

      The launch site is in uncontrolled airspace up to 19,500 feet and we issue
      NOTAMs through the CAA to inform other air traffic when we are launching.
      For our launches we request that the CAA issue a NOTAM for 10,000 feet.
      Our ability to fly to this altitude may change as a result of the current
      consultation document issued by NATS and the CAA to relocate air corridors
      to major airports and holding stacks. (one is likely to be situated on top
      of the EARS site.)
