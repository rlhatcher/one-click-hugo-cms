{{ partial "text-and-image" (dict "heading" "Membership" "text" "The East Anglian Rocketry Society attracts rocket flyers from all over the country to attend our monthly launches from our launch site at Elsworth, near Cambridge. It wasn't always like this, as we didn't have a decent launch site sourced until October 2000. Before that, EARS was really only a couple of people who lived in East Anglia and met up to fly at the bigger launches that were held round the country. The East Anglian Rocketry Society was founded by Peter Wells who'd managed to gain permission to launch from a small micro-light strip just outside Cottenham near Cambridge. The site wasn't ideal due to its thinness and close proximity to a very overgrown orchard. It wasn't until the Midlands based club Thrust lost its flying site in the early half of 2000 that EARS started in earnest to try and find a suitable launch site in East Anglia. Rocket 2A few people got together and had a meeting to try and plan a strategy for finding a site, and managed to find a suitable location to the East of Cambridge on an old airfield. Unfortunately the landowners weren't so keen and we were refused permission to launch from their land. Meanwhile, a Milton Keynes based flyer was trying to source a site near to him, but happened to send letters to a number of farmers in the Cambridgeshire area. One of these farmers got back in touch very quickly as he already had some land set aside for a friend of his to launch rockets from. The site was in uncontrolled airspace, which was a bonus, and it was quite large with a number of parking places off the single track road which loops all the way round it. Without further ado, we got the farmers permission to hold out first launch on the 5th of November 2000 and we have since had over 200 launch meetings."
